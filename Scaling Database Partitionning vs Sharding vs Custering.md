## 🔹 1. Partitioning

**What it is:**
Splitting a single large table into smaller, more manageable pieces (within the same database instance).

* **Types:**

  * Horizontal partitioning → split by rows (e.g., `user_id < 1M` vs `>= 1M`).
  * Vertical partitioning → split by columns (move large/rarely used columns to another table).

* **Where it happens:**
  Inside **one database instance**.

* **Why:**

  * Queries become faster because they scan fewer rows.
  * Indexes are smaller → faster lookups.
  * Maintenance (vacuum, backup, restore) becomes easier.

⚠️ But: **Partitioning does not increase total capacity**.
Your database is still on **one machine**. CPU, memory, disk → still single-node limits.

## 🔹 2. Clustering

**What it is:**
Making multiple servers work together for **high availability** and **load distribution**.

* **Replication cluster (primary + replicas):**

  * One node handles writes, replicas handle reads.
  * Helps with **read scaling** and **failover**.

* **Multi-primary (multi-master):**

  * Multiple nodes accept writes.
  * Harder to maintain consistency, but increases write availability.

* **Where it happens:**
  At the **infrastructure / deployment level** (several database nodes).

* **Why:**

  * High availability (if one node dies, another takes over).
  * Load balancing for reads.
  * Disaster recovery.

⚠️ But: clustering doesn’t reduce table size. If your table has 1B rows, each replica still holds all 1B rows.

## 🔹 3. Sharding

**What it is:**
Splitting your data **across multiple database instances**. Each shard holds only a **subset** of the data.

* **Example:**

  * Shard A → users 1–10M.
  * Shard B → users 10M–20M.
  * Shard C → users 20M–30M.

* **Where it happens:**
  At the **application or middleware layer**.

* **Why:**

  * Break free of a single machine’s limits.
  * Each shard is smaller and faster.
  * Allows near-infinite scaling by adding shards.

⚠️ But: cross-shard queries and transactions are very complex. Often, application logic must know which shard to query.

## 🔹 Why We Need All 3

They solve **different scaling stages**:

1. **Partitioning** → First step when a single table is too big inside one DB.

   * Helps with performance, but doesn’t bypass hardware limits.

2. **Clustering (replication)** → When you need **high availability** and want to scale **reads**.

   * Doesn’t solve “too much data on one node,” just distributes load and provides fault tolerance.

3. **Sharding** → When a single machine can’t handle the **data size or write volume** anymore.

   * True horizontal scale-out.

---

## 🔹 Is Partitioning Enough?

* For **most medium/large apps**, yes. Partitioning + clustering (replicas) is often enough.
* Partitioning works well until:

  * Your **single-node storage** runs out.
  * Your **write throughput** exceeds what one primary node can handle.
* At that point → you need **sharding**.

---

## 🔹 How Much Can Partitioning Do?

Partitioning can give you:

* Faster queries (since scans are smaller).
* Easier maintenance (per-partition backups, index rebuilds).
* Slightly better concurrency (locks are per-partition).

But:

* You’re **still bound to one machine’s resources**.
* Once you reach TBs–PBs of data or 10k+ writes/sec, partitioning alone won’t save you → sharding becomes necessary.

---

✅ **Rule of thumb:**

* **Start with partitioning** (inside single DB).
* **Add clustering/replicas** for availability & read scaling.
* **Only shard** when your single-node database hits a wall (storage/throughput).
