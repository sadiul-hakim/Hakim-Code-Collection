It‚Äôs not always fair to judge a language just by looking at how many flashy **open-source projects** it has on GitHub.

Here‚Äôs why:

### 1. **Different Ecosystem Cultures**

* **Go (Golang)** came out in 2009 with a *strong open-source-first culture*, backed by Google. Most Go developers are used to sharing libraries and tools on GitHub. That‚Äôs why we see projects like Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Prometheus, etc.
* **Java**, on the other hand, was born in the 1990s in a very *enterprise-driven era*. Most big Java projects ended up as **closed-source commercial software** (banking systems, ERPs, trading platforms, telecom billing, etc.). Many companies spent millions building them, so they never released them publicly.

### 2. **Where Java Shines (but hidden from GitHub)**

* **Enterprise software**: Banks, insurance, telecom, governments, healthcare, airlines ‚Äî tons of their ‚Äúmission-critical‚Äù apps are Java. These don‚Äôt live on GitHub.
* **Premium apps**: Large enterprise software products (SAP modules, Atlassian Jira/Confluence, Eclipse IDE, Android SDK tools, etc.) are Java-based, but not always open source.
* **Closed-source frameworks**: A lot of middleware, financial trading platforms, logistics and ERP backends, etc. are in Java but owned by companies.

### 3. **Open-source bias**

* Open source projects get **visibility** on GitHub.
* Closed-source projects may have **10x more code, complexity, and users**, but we don‚Äôt see them.
* So Go *looks* more active in OSS, while Java has a ton of ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù production-grade software.

### 4. **Different Goals**

* Go was designed for **cloud-native infrastructure** ‚Üí naturally leads to open-source tools.
* Java was designed for **enterprise apps** ‚Üí naturally leads to proprietary systems.

üëâ So, judging Java by its open-source GitHub activity would underestimate its real-world dominance. Java may not have as many trendy OSS projects, but it has an enormous footprint in **critical closed-source systems** that power banks, governments, telcos, and Fortune 500 companies.
