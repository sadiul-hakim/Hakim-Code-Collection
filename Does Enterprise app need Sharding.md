⚡ **Database issues like sharding and extreme partitioning usually show up in *public, internet-scale apps*** (Facebook, Twitter, TikTok).
But **enterprise apps** (internal ERPs, CRMs, HR systems, banking backends) often have **different scaling patterns**.

Let’s compare:

---

## 🔹 Public Internet Apps (social media, e-commerce, SaaS at huge scale)

* **User base:** Millions → billions of users.
* **Traffic pattern:** Extremely high concurrency (thousands–millions of requests/sec).
* **Data growth:** Enormous (petabytes).
* **Primary challenge:** Scale **horizontally** across many servers.
* **Database problems:**

  * Sharding (Twitter users by ID, Instagram media by user ID).
  * Eventual consistency (likes/comments replicated asynchronously).
  * Write-heavy workloads (social feeds, likes, posts).

---

## 🔹 Enterprise Apps (banking systems, ERPs, logistics, insurance, healthcare)

* **User base:** Usually thousands → tens of thousands (employees, clients).
* **Traffic pattern:** Predictable and lower concurrency (hundreds–thousands of requests/sec).
* **Data growth:** Large, but not internet-scale (GBs → TBs, sometimes multi-TB).
* **Primary challenge:**

  * **Correctness, integrity, compliance** (ACID transactions matter more than scale).
  * **Complex queries** (analytics, reports, joins across many tables).
* **Database problems:**

  * Concurrency control (avoiding deadlocks, phantom reads, lost updates).
  * Schema evolution (safe migrations with Liquibase/Flyway).
  * Performance tuning (indexes, query plans, partitioning for large historical tables).
  * Auditing & security (who changed what, GDPR, SOX compliance).
  * High availability (replication/failover, but not usually sharding).

---

## 🔹 Key Differences in Focus

* **Public apps:** Scale → “How do I handle 10M writes/sec?”
* **Enterprise apps:** Reliability & correctness → “How do I make sure financial transactions never get corrupted, even if two accountants update the same invoice at the same time?”

---

## 🔹 So, Do Enterprise Apps Need Sharding?

👉 **Almost never.**

* They rely on **vertical scaling + partitioning + replicas**.
* Example: A bank can run on Oracle/Postgres clusters with strong HA and partitioned transaction tables, and it’s fine.
* Instead of sharding, enterprises often **archive old data** (e.g., move 7-year-old invoices into a separate data warehouse).

## 🔹 Typical Database Scaling in Enterprise

1. **Normalization** → to maintain data integrity.
2. **Indexing & Query optimization** → most important.
3. **Partitioning** → for very large transaction/history tables (e.g., monthly partitions).
4. **Replication/Clustering** → for high availability and read-heavy reporting.
5. **Data warehousing (ETL)** → separate OLAP DB (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift) for reporting/analytics.
6. **Archiving** → move old data to cold storage.

✅ **Rule of Thumb**:

* **Public apps** care about **scaling out** (handle billions of users).
* **Enterprise apps** care about **scaling correctly** (handle critical data with no corruption).
